# Local Home SDK Virtual Environment

This is a collection of stubs for the [Local Home SDK](https://github.com/actions-on-google/local-home-sdk) as well as manual testing interfaces for interacting with them.

**This repository consists of three components:**

- `stubs/` holds the library of core stubs that implement `smarthome` namespace in Node.js. 

- `cli/` is a tool for interacting with the stubs through a command-line interface that runs in Node.js.

- `gui/` is an implementation of the `smarthome` stubs that runs in a browser and exposes a GUI for triggering platform actions.

Please see each respective `README` for complete usage guides.
